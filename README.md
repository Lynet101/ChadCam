# ChadCam
**A free and open source messaging and VOIP app**

**How it works**
ChadCam is going to work with PTP connections primarily, this means that there will be (close to) no server backend. 
When you want to chat or encage with a call, a direct connection is made between you, and the other party/parties. 
This way we can minimize server costs, and thereby keep this project completely free of charge, as well as ad and spy free
