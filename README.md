# ChadCam
**A free and open source messaging and VOIP app**

## How it works
ChadCam is going to work with PTP connections primarily, this means that there will be (close to) no server backend. 
When you want to chat or encage with a call, a direct connection is made between you, and the other party/parties. 
This way we can minimize server costs, and thereby keep this project completely free of charge, as well as ad and spy free

***But what about saving chat history?***

Chat history is going to be saved on your local device, but a backup solution will be provided to back it up (just like you would back up all of your other data) to G-drive, onedrive, mega, dropbox, etc. An official backup solution might also be created at some point, however it is at this point uncertain if it will be created, and whether or not this might be a paid feature (as servers cost $$$)

***Cross device sync***

A PTP device sync will be implemented where all the "nodes" can talk to one another, and sync with one another. Or that's at least the idea xD
